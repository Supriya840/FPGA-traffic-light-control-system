# FPGA-traffic-light-control-system

This project uses Verilog HDL to implement a Traffic Light Controller based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) on a Xilinx FPGA. Based on predetermined timing rules, the system regulates traffic signals at a two-road intersection, guaranteeing safe and timed switching between Green, Yellow, and Red lights.

Xilinx ISE 14.7 is used to write, simulate, and synthesize the design; ISim waveform simulation is used to confirm the behavior. Fundamentals of digital design, such as FSM design and timing control are demonstrated in this project.
